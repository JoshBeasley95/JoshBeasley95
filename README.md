# Joshua Beasley — Data Science Portfolio


Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases a curated set of real-world data science and AI projects that I've built from end to end — covering predictive modeling, app development, marketing analytics, fraud detection, and more.


Each project includes:
- Code + Models
- Dashboards or Apps (Streamlit)
- Dataset summaries (synthetic if proprietary)
- Loom walkthroughs (for interactive demos)
